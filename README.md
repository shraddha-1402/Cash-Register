# CASH REGISTER

**An app which will make your money transactions as easy as cakewalk**

This app takes the payble amount and the paid amount and gives the minimum change that one needs to return to the customer.

## How the app works

* First you need to enter the amount you need to pay in the input box
* Click next, make sure the amount is not negative
* Now, enter the amount you paid, make sure the amount is greater than the bill amount
* By clicking on check button you will get the total change you need to return along with the count of notes


**Now, head to [Cash Register](https://cash-register-management.netlify.app/) and use the app for all your money transactions!**
